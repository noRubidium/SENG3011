Hey, when your superhuman CEO Don Meij has his own eponymous website devoted to his incomparable achievements, it can be almost impossible to fathom how and why anybody could ever say or write anything about you that isn't utterly adulatory.\n\nOn Friday last week, Domino's issued a terse statement in response to an article in this newspaper (\"Domino's shares slump as surcharge bites\"), stating it \"has seen no evidence [of] a link between share price and the recent introduction of a Sunday surcharge\".\n\nBut Domino's shares had slumped (by 8.8 per cent) since it slapped a 10 per cent surcharge on pizzas sold on Sundays to help offset a 25 per cent pay rise awarded to its staff. On Tuesday, Domino's shares closed at $59.45 \u2013 now down 10.5 per cent since January 8, when they closed at $66.45. So to what then is Domino's instead attributing this slump? Trump, or Brexit? Chinese New Year?
