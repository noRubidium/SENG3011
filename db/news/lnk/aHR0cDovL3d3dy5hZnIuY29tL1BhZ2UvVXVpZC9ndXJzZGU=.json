Online and digital sales now represent 70 per cent of Domino's total sales, up from 1 per cent in 2006. \"Technology has enabled us to change the game,\" Mr Meij said. Domino's is now harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to boost pizza sales, adding new features and devices to its DRU (Domino's Robotic Unit) platform. On Monday the company launched DRU Assist, a voice-activated digital assistant that takes customers' orders on mobile phones, desktops and laptops. DRU Assist will be followed by DRU Manager, which helps franchisees automate rosters and order stock based on forecast demand.\n\nAfter delivering its first pizza by drone in New Zealand last year, Domino's is working with Flirtey to design stronger, faster drones than can deliver multiple pizzas and drinks. Next year customers will be able to order pizza through voice-activated devices such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home. \"It's not just a gimmick or attention-seeking headlines. We have a genuine business case behind DRU,\" Mr Meij told the summit. Australians were embracing technology at such a rapid rate, he said, that within three years there would not be enough people to meet demand for home delivery and it would become increasingly inefficient for two-tonne trucks to deliver pizza in built-up areas.", "image": "http://www.afr.com/content/dam/images/g/u/o/8/r/g/image.related.socialLead.620x349.gursde.png/1488974513442.jpg", "summary": "Domino's is now harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to boost pizza sales, adding new features and devices to its DRU (Domino's Robotic Unit) platform.\nOnline and digital sales now represent 70 per cent of Domino's total sales, up from 1 per cent in 2006.\nWe have a genuine business case behind DRU,\" Mr Meij told the summit.\nNext year customers will be able to order pizza through voice-activated devices such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home.\nOn Monday the company launched DRU Assist, a voice-activated digital assistant that takes customers' orders on mobile phones, desktops and laptops.", "url": "http://www.afr.com/Page/Uuid/gursde", "date": "2017-03-08", "involved_companies": ["DMP"]}
